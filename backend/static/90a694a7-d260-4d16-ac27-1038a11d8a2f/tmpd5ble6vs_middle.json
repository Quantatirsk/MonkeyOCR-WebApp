Inspired by the efficient decision-making dynamics of fish schools, CSI divides a human population into a set of small subgroups connected by AI agents. This enables the full group to hold a unified conversation. In this study, groups of 25 participants were tasked with selecting a roster of players in a real Fantasy Baseball contest. A total of 10 trials were run using CSI. In half the trials, each subgroup was augmented with a fact-providing AI agent referred to herein as an Infobot. The Infobot was loaded with a wide range of MLB statistics. The human participants could query the Infobot the same way they would query other persons in their subgroup. Results show that when using CSI, the 25-person groups outperformed 72% of individually surveyed participants and showed significant intelligence amplification versus the mean score (p=0.016). The CSI-enabled groups also significantly outperformed the most popular picks across the collected surveys for each daily contest (p<0.001). The CSI sessions that used Infobots scored slightly higher than those that did not, but it was not statistically significant in this study. That said, 85% of participants agreed with the statement \"Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot,\" and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations that used Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content across members. This suggests that Infobots promoted more balanced discussions in which fewer members dominated the dialog. This may be because the infobot enabled participants to confidently express opinions with the support of factual data.",

In addition, an academic study is described in which CSI technology, with and without the infobot feature, is tested in a real-world forecasting task â€“ the selection of a roster of players in a daily Fantasy Baseball contest. This task was chosen because it offers a complex, open-ended scenario in which participants must make tradeoffs to balance competing factors within a fixed budget. Specifically, groups are required to strategically allocate their budget and manage tradeoffs by collectively deliberating about how much to spend on particularly players on their team. We compare the performance of groups reaching collective decisions via traditional survey aggregation against groups deliberating using an online CSI platform called Thinkscapeâ„¢, with and without the use of Infobots. We also collect subjective feedback about the participants' experience deliberating using CSI technology and about the perceived value of Infobots.",

As implemented in current tools like Thinkscape, hundreds of individuals can hold thoughtful deliberations in which they collectively brainstorm ideas, debate alternatives, prioritize options, estimate outcomes and converge on unified solutions that have been shown to amplify collective intelligence [6-9]. Current CSI platforms support text-based conversations (with optional voice-to-text). Future platforms could use the same method to enable videoconferencing at a very large scale.",

Inspired by the efficient decision-making dynamics of fish schools, CSI divides a human population into a set of small subgroups connected by AI agents. This enables the full group to hold a unified conversation. In this study, groups of 25 participants were tasked with selecting a roster of players in a real Fantasy Baseball contest. A total of 10 trials were run using CSI. In half the trials, each subgroup was augmented with a fact-providing AI agent referred to herein as an Infobot. The Infobot was loaded with a wide range of MLB statistics. The human participants could query the Infobot the same way they would query other persons in their subgroup. Results show that when using CSI, the 25-person groups outperformed 72% of individually surveyed participants and showed significant intelligence amplification versus the mean score (p=0.016). The CSI-enabled groups also significantly outperformed the most popular picks across the collected surveys for each daily contest (p<0.001). The CSI sessions that used Infobots scored slightly higher than those that did not, but it was not statistically significant in this study. That said, 85% of participants agreed with the statement \"Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot,\" and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations that used Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content across members. This suggests that Infobots promoted more balanced discussions in which fewer members dominated the dialog. This may be because the infobot enabled participants to confidently express opinions with the support of factual data.",

In the sections below, the basic principles of CSI are reviewed, and a new feature called an \"infobot\" is introduced. In addition, an academic study is described in which CSI technology, with and without the infobot feature, is tested in a real-world forecasting task â€“ the selection of a roster of players in a daily Fantasy Baseball contest. This task was chosen because it offers a complex, open-ended scenario in which participants must make tradeoffs to balance competing factors within a fixed budget. Specifically, groups are required to strategically allocate their budget and manage tradeoffs by collectively deliberating about how much to spend on particularly players on their team. We compare the performance of groups reaching collective decisions via traditional survey aggregation against groups deliberating using an online CSI platform called Thinkscapeâ„¢, with and without the use of Infobots. We also collect subjective feedback about the participants' experience deliberating using CSI technology and about the perceived value of Infobots.",

Although large groups can congregate in online chatrooms or videoconferencing platforms, deliberating at scale is rarely effective, as conversational quality degrades with group size. Research shows that when groups grow beyond 4 to 7 individuals, deliberations tend to become less effective. Each person gets less time to speak, they have to wait longer to respond to others, and often a few dominant personalities control the conversation and sway the full group in a biased direction [10-12].",

Large schools can make effective life-or-death decisions extremely quickly despite the fact that (i) each individual has a very limited view of the world around them and the real-time threats they face (i.e., partial information) and (b) the group has no central authority that oversees the decision-making process. Evolution developed an efficient solution by enabling each member of the school to \"deliberate\" in real-time with a small set of nearby fish (i.e. neighbors) using a specialized organ called a lateral line. This unique organ detects pressure changes and vibrations in the water caused by the movements of their neighbors. Since each small groups overlap with other small groups, the local decisions propagate across subgroups, enabling information to quickly spread through the full population. This allows thousands of fish to rapidly converge on unified decisions in real-time [14].",

This alone does not solve the problem, however. That's because humans do not possess the fish-like ability to deliberate within overlapping subgroups. In fact, we find it extremely challenging to participate effectively in more than one conversation at a time. Researchers often refer to this human limitation as the \"cocktail party problem\" because parties are a very common venue where small conversational subgroups congregate in close proximity. In such settings, if a person's attention shifts to a neighboring conversation instead of the one they are in, their ability to follow both conversation quickly diminishes. In fact, humans evolved the opposite capability â€“ we are quite skilled at tuning-out neighboring conversations so we can focus intently on local conversation we are engaged in. [14]",

CSI achieves this by automatically dividing a large group into a network of small subgroups and inserting a Surrogate Agent into each subgroup. The Surrogate Agent is tasked with observing the local deliberation of the group it is in, distilling the real-time content, and efficiently passing critical points to other subgroups where its local Surrogate Agent will express those points as natural dialog within that local conversation.

Using this structure, the Surrogate Agent within each subgroup can pass or receive content from any other subgroup in the network, mediated by a matchmaking subsystem that intelligently considers the real-time conversational content in all subgroups in real-time and passes content between groups in a manner that maximize the mixing of diverse insights. In addition, the CSI structure is inherently scalable. This means it could be used to connect hundreds, thousands, or potentially even millions of individual participants in real-time, either using a flat architecture (as shown below) or a nested structure in which a hierarchy is used in the network architecture that creates subgroups of subgroups.",

In addition, CSI reduces the biasing influence of strong personalities (i.e. loudmouths) because each individual is only directly exposed to a small subgroup of others in real-time. For an insight to propagate beyond its originating subgroup, it must be compelling on its own merits. Similarly, CSI combats the biasing influence of early comments swaying the full group, as if often the problem in traditional focus groups. In the diagram above, different \"early comments\" would emerge in all 14 subgroups and would spread across the network based on their merits, not the timing of when they were introduced.",

Although large groups can congregate in online chatrooms or videoconferencing platforms, deliberating at scale is rarely effective, as conversational quality degrades with group size. Research shows that when groups grow beyond 4 to 7 individuals, deliberations tend to become less effective. Each person gets less time to speak, they have to wait longer to respond to others, and often a few dominant personalities control the conversation and sway the full group in a biased direction [10-12].",

Evolution developed an efficient solution by enabling each member of the school to \"deliberate\" in real-time with a small set of nearby fish (i.e. neighbors) using a specialized organ called a lateral line. This unique organ detects pressure changes and vibrations in the water caused by the movements of their neighbors. Since each small groups overlap with other small groups, the local decisions propagate across subgroups, enabling information to quickly spread through the full population. This allows thousands of fish to rapidly converge on unified decisions in real-time [14].",

This alone does not solve the problem, however. That's because humans do not possess the fish-like ability to deliberate within overlapping subgroups. In fact, we find it extremely challenging to participate effectively in more than one conversation at a time. Researchers often refer to this human limitation as the \"cocktail party problem\" because parties are a very common venue where small conversational subgroups congregate in close proximity. In such settings, if a person's attention shifts to a neighboring conversation instead of the one they are in, their ability to follow both conversation quickly diminishes. In fact, humans evolved the opposite capability â€“ we are quite skilled at tuning-out neighboring conversations so we can focus intently on local conversation we are engaged in. [14]",

CSI achieves this by automatically dividing a large group into a network of small subgroups and inserting a Surrogate Agent into each subgroup. The Surrogate Agent is tasked with observing the local deliberation of the group it is in, distilling the real-time content, and efficiently passing critical points to other subgroups where its local Surrogate Agent will express those points as natural dialog within that local conversation.

As shown, each subgroup is populated with an AI-powered Surrogate Agent. While the diagram only shows network connections between pairs of subgroups, the Thinkscape CSI platform used in this study employed a fully connected network architecture among subgroups. Using this structure, the Surrogate Agent within each subgroup can pass or receive content from any other subgroup in the network, mediated by a matchmaking subsystem that intelligently considers the real-time conversational content in all subgroups in real-time and passes content between groups in a manner that maximize the mixing of diverse insights. In addition, the CSI structure is inherently scalable. This means it could be used to connect hundreds, thousands, or potentially even millions of individual participants in real-time, either using a flat architecture (as shown below) or a nested structure in which a hierarchy is used in the network architecture that creates subgroups of subgroups.",

For an insight to propagate beyond its originating subgroup, it must be compelling on its own merits. Similarly, CSI combats the biasing influence of early comments swaying the full group, as if often the problem in traditional focus groups. In the diagram above, different \"early comments\" would emerge in all 14 subgroups and would spread across the network based on their merits, not the timing of when they were introduced.",

The study compared individual survey performance on the IQ (as individuals and by WoC aggregation) versus groupwise decisions emerging from conversational deliberations in a CSI-based conversational platform. In all cases, participants were allotted the same time per question. Compared to the average individual IQ score of 100 (the 50th percentile), CSI groups scored an IQ of 128 (97th percentile) which is considered \"gifted\" by most criteria. This significantly outperformed the WoC aggregation which scored IQ of 115 (84th percentile). In addition, not a single participant that was tested in this study scored a personal IQ that was as high as the groups deliberating together using the CSI platform [15]. This result suggests that CSI may be a possible pathway to enabling very large groups to form a collective superintelligence.",

To capture baseline data, participants were also tasked with creating their own personal roster using a standard survey. The task required participants to \"purchase\" a set of 5 players to (bi-weekly) for their team while staying within a fixed budget. To reduce the amount of time required for the participants, a set of six player options were provided for each of the five positions along with salary information for \"purchasing\" that player based on current DraftKings data. Thus, each session required participants to select five players, each from a different set of 6 available players (each with unique performance data and salary requirements), and do this while staying within a predefined budget. This task demands making tradeoffs between the value of spending money on certain positions (i.e., first base, pitcher, shortstop) versus others. For example, if the collaborating spends too much on the best hitter available, they may not have funds left to get a top pitcher. While no perfect strategy exists to optimize score, an effective strategy requires the group to make skilled and thoughtful tradeoffs.",

The study compared individual survey performance on the IQ (as individuals and by WoC aggregation) versus groupwise decisions emerging from conversational deliberations in a CSI-based conversational platform. In all cases, participants were allotted the same time per question. Compared to the average individual IQ score of 100 (the 50th percentile), CSI groups scored an IQ of 128 (97th percentile) which is considered \"gifted\" by most criteria. This significantly outperformed the WoC aggregation which scored IQ of 115 (84th percentile). In addition, not a single participant that was tested in this study scored a personal IQ that was as high as the groups deliberating together using the CSI platform [15]. This result suggests that CSI may be a possible pathway to enabling very large groups to form a collective superintelligence.",

As implemented, an Infobot is primed with specific factual information regarding the task or problem at hand and added to each subgroup (independently). Each Infobot is designed to respond to factual queries from members of its subgroup, providing factual information that is strictly limited to the topic at hand and the set of factual data it was primed with. The infobots are conversational. They are designed to participate in each subgroup alongside human participants. The only difference is that infobots can only respond to direct queries and only give factual responses.",

To capture baseline data, participants were also tasked with creating their own personal roster using a standard survey. The task required participants to \"purchase\" a set of 5 players to (bi-weekly) for their team while staying within a fixed budget. To reduce the amount of time required for the participants, a set of six player options were provided for each of the five positions along with salary information for \"purchasing\" that player based on current DraftKings data. Thus, each session required participants to select five players, each from a different set of 6 available players (each with unique performance data and salary requirements), and do this while staying within a predefined budget. This task demands making tradeoffs between the value of spending money on certain positions (i.e., first base, pitcher, shortstop) versus others. For example, if the collaborating spends too much on the best hitter available, they may not have funds left to get a top pitcher. While no perfect strategy exists to optimize score, an effective strategy requires the group to make skilled and thoughtful tradeoffs.",

On average, groups using the CSI platform exceeded the score of 73% of individually generated rosters. This was significantly more accurate than the WoC method which outperformed 39% of individually generated rosters (p-value=0.011) and greatly exceeded the Median individual score (p-value = 0.016) using a Wilcoxon Rank Test for the points scored by lineup choices. Additionally, we are 99% confident that the true percentile performance of CSI-based sessions is between 69% and 77%. In addition, a bootstrap test was performed by resampling 10,000 times over the observed participant scores. This test indicated that the CSI method is likely to outperform the majority of individuals 95% of the time.",

On average, groups using the CSI platform exceeded the score of 73% of individually generated rosters. This was significantly more accurate than the WoC method which outperformed 39% of individually generated rosters (p-value=0.011) and greatly exceeded the Median individual score (p-value = 0.016) using a Wilcoxon Rank Test for the points scored by lineup choices. Additionally, we are 99% confident that the true percentile performance of CSI-based sessions is between 69% and 77%. In addition, a bootstrap test was performed by resampling 10,000 times over the observed participant scores. This test indicated that the CSI method is likely to outperform the majority of individuals 95% of the time.",

In this example, the group is down to their final position selection of the day and is collaboratively considering who to pick to play Second Base in their roster. The six choices available to them are shown in Table 3 below along with the cost of purchasing each player. The group's remaining budget is $4,900. From a reputation perspective, Marcus Semien is considered the best player in the set, but he is also the most expensive. That said, the group had sufficient budget left to cover this cost, so he would be the common pick for most participants. In fact, the survey results showed a strong majority picking Semien.",

In this case, the actual results of this non-obvious pick have interesting anecdotal value. That's because of all six players the group could have chosen for that Fantasy Baseball session, the one that scored the highest when the games were played was in fact Brendan Rogers. On the other hand, the obvious pick by aggregating conventional wisdom, Marcus Semien, underperformed expectations. Ultimately it is because of this type of dynamic in a variety of questions across the 5-week study that enabled the CSI groups (with and without Infobots) to outperform most individuals and outperform the WoC aggregations.",

These surveys were aggregated across all 10 sessions, each including approximately 25 respondents. As shown in Figure 5, Tables 4 and Table 5, over 90% of respondents agreed with each of the positive statements about CSI tested, and over 80% of respondents disagreed with the negative statements about CSI tested. Taken together, these results suggest that participants in CSI deliberations felt strongly that their perspectives were heard and considered by others, and that group benefited from the CSI deliberations and converged thoughtfully on strong solutions without rushing to conclusions. Thus, these CSI groups did not suffer from low psychological safety, or the sense that offering opinions will be met with negative judgements, commonly found in deliberating groups.",

This may be because the Infobot is an \"equalizer\" among participants, giving those who have less factual knowledge about MLB an easy way to consider the player rigorously and make confident comments that they may not have made if they felt insecure in their expertise compared to other members of their subgroup.",

In this example, the group is down to their final position selection of the day and is collaboratively considering who to pick to play Second Base in their roster. The six choices available to them are shown in Table 3 below along with the cost of purchasing each player. The group's remaining budget is $4,900. From a reputation perspective, Marcus Semien is considered the best player in the set, but he is also the most expensive. That said, the group had sufficient budget left to cover this cost, so he would be the common pick for most participants. In fact, the survey results showed a strong majority picking Semien.",

In this case, the actual results of this non-obvious pick have interesting anecdotal value. That's because of all six players the group could have chosen for that Fantasy Baseball session, the one that scored the highest when the games were played was in fact Brendan Rogers. On the other hand, the obvious pick by aggregating conventional wisdom, Marcus Semien, underperformed expectations. Ultimately it is because of this type of dynamic in a variety of questions across the 5-week study that enabled the CSI groups (with and without Infobots) to outperform most individuals and outperform the WoC aggregations.",

These surveys were aggregated across all 10 sessions, each including approximately 25 respondents. As shown in Figure 5, Tables 4 and Table 5, over 90% of respondents agreed with each of the positive statements about CSI tested, and over 80% of respondents disagreed with the negative statements about CSI tested. Taken together, these results suggest that participants in CSI deliberations felt strongly that their perspectives were heard and considered by others, and that group benefited from the CSI deliberations and converged thoughtfully on strong solutions without rushing to conclusions. Thus, these CSI groups did not suffer from low psychological safety, or the sense that offering opinions will be met with negative judgements, commonly found in deliberating groups.",

These results show that participants queried the Infobots regularly for factual information during all 25 questions in which Infobot was present. Although the groups were not required to use the Infobot to help in deliberation, an average of 4.1 Infobot queries were made per subgroup per player being selected. The consistency of use of the Infobot is also of note, with all questions averaging between 2.8 and 5.5 queries per subgroup. The fact that all subgroups consistently made strong use of the infobot without being required to do so, suggests strong value from this feature during group deliberations.",

To perform well, collectives needed to weigh the benefits of picking the highest performing players for certain positions against the benefits of saving budget for other positions on the roster.",

The CSI groups also outperformed the most popular picks across sets of 25 of surveys for each daily contest (p<0.001).

These results show that participants queried the Infobots regularly for factual information during all 25 questions in which Infobot was present. Although the groups were not required to use the Infobot to help in deliberation, an average of 4.1 Infobot queries were made per subgroup per player being selected. The consistency of use of the Infobot is also of note, with all questions averaging between 2.8 and 5.5 queries per subgroup. The fact that all subgroups consistently made strong use of the infobot without being required to do so, suggests strong value from this feature during group deliberations.",

Each conversational subgroup of 5 participants had access to their own Infobot and used it frequently (on average, 4.1 queries per player being selected). There was not a significant difference in scoring between the CSI sessions with and without Infobots, but the feedback from participants was very positive. 85% of participants agreed with the statement \"Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot,\" and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations in subgroups using Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content. This suggests that Infobots promoted more balanced discussions in which fewer members dominated the dialog. This may be because the infobot enabled participants to confidently express opinions on players that they might not have known a lot about as a consequence of asking the Infobot for factual information. Finally, participants reported that they could speak freely without fear of negative interpersonal repercussions, which suggests the CSI platform and Infobot AI assistant facilitated open discussions without falling victim to common conversational issues found in large groups.",

Each conversational subgroup of 5 participants had access to their own Infobot and used it frequently (on average, 4.1 queries per player being selected). There was not a significant difference in scoring between the CSI sessions with and without Infobots, but the feedback from participants was very positive. 85% of participants agreed with the statement \"Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot,\" and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations in subgroups using Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content. This suggests that Infobots promoted more balanced discussions in which fewer members dominated the dialog. This may be because the infobot enabled participants to confidently express opinions on players that they might not have known a lot about as a consequence of asking the Infobot for factual information. Finally, participants reported that they could speak freely without fear of negative interpersonal repercussions, which suggests the CSI platform and Infobot AI assistant facilitated open discussions without falling victim to common conversational issues found in large groups.",
