        "text": "Abstract— Conversational Swarm Intelligence (CSI) is an AI-powered communication and collaboration technology that allows large, networked groups (of potentially unlimited size) to hold thoughtful conversational deliberations in real-time. Inspired by the efficient decision-making dynamics of fish schools, CSI divides a human population into a set of small subgroups connected by AI agents. This enables the full group to hold a unified conversation. In this study, groups of 25 participants were tasked with selecting a roster of players in a real Fantasy Baseball contest. A total of 10 trials were run using CSI. In half the trials, each subgroup was augmented with a fact-providing AI agent referred to herein as an Infobot. The Infobot was loaded with a wide range of MLB statistics. The human participants could query the Infobot the same way they would query other persons in their subgroup. Results show that when using CSI, the 25-person groups outperformed 72% of individually surveyed participants and showed significant intelligence amplification versus the mean score (p=0.016). The CSI-enabled groups also significantly outperformed the most popular picks across the collected surveys for each daily contest (p<0.001). The CSI sessions that used Infobots scored slightly higher than those that did not, but it was not statistically significant in this study. That said, 85% of participants agreed with the statement \"Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot,\" and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations that used Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content across members. This suggests that Infobots promoted more balanced discussions in which fewer members dominated the dialog. This may be because the infobot enabled participants to confidently express opinions with the support of factual data. ",

In addition, an academic study is described in which CSI technology, with and without the infobot feature, is tested in a real-world forecasting task – the selection of a roster of players in a daily Fantasy Baseball contest. This task was chosen because it offers a complex, open-ended scenario in which participants must make tradeoffs to balance competing factors within a fixed budget. Specifically, groups are required to strategically allocate their budget and manage tradeoffs by collectively deliberating about how much to spend on particularly players on their team. We compare the performance of groups reaching collective decisions via traditional survey aggregation against groups deliberating using an online CSI platform called Thinkscape™, with and without the use of Infobots. We also collect subjective feedback about the participants' experience deliberating using CSI technology and about the perceived value of Infobots. ",

Evolution developed an efficient solution by enabling each member of the school to \"deliberate\" in real-time with a small set of nearby fish (i.e. neighbors) using a specialized organ called a lateral line. This unique organ detects pressure changes and vibrations in the water caused by the movements of their neighbors. Since each small groups overlap with other small groups, the local decisions propagate across subgroups, enabling information to quickly spread through the full population. This allows thousands of fish to rapidly converge on unified decisions in real-time [14]. ",

This alone does not solve the problem, however. That's because humans do not possess the fish-like ability to deliberate within overlapping subgroups. In fact, we find it extremely challenging to participate effectively in more than one conversation at a time. Researchers often refer to this human limitation as the \"cocktail party problem\" because parties are a very common venue where small conversational subgroups congregate in close proximity. In such settings, if a person's attention shifts to a neighboring conversation instead of the one they are in, their ability to follow both conversation quickly diminishes. In fact, humans evolved the opposite capability – we are quite skilled at tuning-out neighboring conversations so we can focus intently on local conversation we are engaged in. [14] ",

CSI achieves this by automatically dividing a large group into a network of small subgroups and inserting a Surrogate Agent into each subgroup. The Surrogate Agent is tasked with observing the local deliberation of the group it is in, distilling the real-time content, and efficiently passing critical points to other subgroups where its local Surrogate Agent will express those points as natural dialog within that local conversation.

There was not a significant difference in scoring between the CSI sessions with and without Infobots, but the feedback from participants was very positive. 85% of participants agreed with the statement \"Our decisions were stronger because of information provided by the Infobot,\" and only 4% disagreed. In addition, deliberations in subgroups using Infobots showed significantly less variance (p=0.039) in conversational content. This suggests that Infobots promoted more balanced discussions in which fewer members dominated the dialog. This may be because the infobot enabled participants to confidently express opinions on players that they might not have known a lot about as a consequence of asking the Infobot for factual information. Finally, participants reported that they could speak freely without fear of negative interpersonal repercussions, which suggests the CSI platform and Infobot AI assistant facilitated open discussions without falling victim to common conversational issues found in large groups.
