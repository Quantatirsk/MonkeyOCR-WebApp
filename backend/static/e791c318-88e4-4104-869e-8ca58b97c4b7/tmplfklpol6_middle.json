Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks for large language model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval, enterprise applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources including ongoing conversations and business data. Zep addresses this fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti—a temporally-aware knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both unstructured conversational data and structured business data while maintaining historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team established as their primary evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better reflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up to 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to baseline implementations. These results are particularly pronounced in enterprise-critical tasks such as cross-session information synthesis and long-term context maintenance, demonstrating Zep's effectiveness for deployment in real-world applications.",

For agents to become pervasive in our daily lives, autonomously solving problems from trivial to highly complex, they will need access to a large corpus of continuously evolving data from users' interactions with the agent, along with related business and world data. We view empowering agents with this broad and dynamic \"memory\" as a crucial building block to actualize this vision, and we argue that current RAG approaches are unsuitable for this future. Since entire conversation histories, business datasets, and other domain-specific content cannot fit effectively inside LLM context windows, new approaches need to be developed for agent",

Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks for large language model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval, enterprise applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources including ongoing conversations and business data. Zep addresses this fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti—a temporally-aware knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both unstructured conversational data and structured business data while maintaining historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team established as their primary evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better reflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up to 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to baseline implementations. These results are particularly pronounced in enterprise-critical tasks such as cross-session information synthesis and long-term context maintenance, demonstrating Zep's effectiveness for deployment in real-world applications.",

For agents to become pervasive in our daily lives, autonomously solving problems from trivial to highly complex, they will need access to a large corpus of continuously evolving data from users' interactions with the agent, along with related business and world data. We view empowering agents with this broad and dynamic \"memory\" as a crucial building block to actualize this vision, and we argue that current RAG approaches are unsuitable for this future. Since entire conversation histories, business datasets, and other domain-specific content cannot fit effectively inside LLM context windows, new approaches need to be developed for agent",

Zep ingests and synthesizes both unstructured message data and structured business data. The Graphiti KG engine dynamically updates the knowledge graph with new information in a non-lossy manner, maintaining a timeline of facts and relationships, including their periods of validity. This approach enables the knowledge graph to represent a complex, evolving world.",

Zep ingests and synthesizes both unstructured message data and structured business data. The Graphiti KG engine dynamically updates the knowledge graph with new information in a non-lossy manner, maintaining a timeline of facts and relationships, including their periods of validity. This approach enables the knowledge graph to represent a complex, evolving world.",

Zep implements a bi-temporal model, where timeline $T$ represents the chronological ordering of events, and timeline $T'$ represents the transactional order of Zep's data ingestion. While the $T'$ timeline serves the traditional purpose of database auditing, the $T$ timeline provides an additional dimension for modeling the dynamic nature of conversational data and memory.

During ingestion, the system processes both the current message content and the last $n$ messages to provide context for named entity recognition. For this paper and in Zep's general implementation, $n=4$, providing two complete conversation turns for context evaluation. Given our focus on message processing, the speaker is automatically extracted as an entity. Following initial entity extraction, we employ a reflection technique inspired by reflexion[12] to minimize hallucinations and enhance extraction coverage. The system also extracts an entity summary from the episode to facilitate subsequent entity resolution and retrieval operations.",

Episodes and their derived semantic edges maintain bidirectional indices that track the relationships between edges and their source episodes. This design reinforces the non-lossy nature of Graphiti's episodic subgraph by enabling both forward and backward traversal: semantic artifacts can be traced to their sources for citation or quotation, while episodes can quickly retrieve their relevant entities and facts. While these connections are not directly examined in this paper's experiments, they will be explored in future work.",

Additionally, Zep implements a graph-based episode-mentions reranker that prioritizes results based on the frequency of entity or fact mentions within a conversation, enabling a system where frequently referenced information becomes more readily accessible. The system also includes a node distance reranker that reorders results based on their graph distance from a designated centroid node, providing context localized to specific areas of the knowledge graph. The system's most sophisticated reranking capability employs cross-encoders—LLMs that generate relevance scores by evaluating nodes and edges against queries using cross-attention though this approach incurs the highest computational cost.",

In Graphiti, the breadth-first search enhances initial search results by identifying additional nodes and edges within $n$-hops. Moreover, $\\varphi_{\\text{bfs}}$ can accept nodes as parameters for the search, enabling greater control over the search function. This functionality proves particularly valuable when using recent episodes as seeds for the breadth-first search, allowing the system to incorporate recently mentioned entities and relationships into the retrieved context.",

Zep supports existing reranking approaches such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) [20] and Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [21]. Additionally, Zep implements a graph-based episode-mentions reranker that prioritizes results based on the frequency of entity or fact mentions within a conversation, enabling a system where frequently referenced information becomes more readily accessible. The system also includes a node distance reranker that reorders results based on their graph distance from a designated centroid node, providing context localized to specific areas of the knowledge graph. The system's most sophisticated reranking capability employs cross-encoders—LLMs that generate relevance scores by evaluating nodes and edges against queries using cross-attention though this approach incurs the highest computational cost.",

Most critically the dataset poorly represents real-world enterprise use cases for LLM agents.

Given that the current MemGPT framework does not support direct ingestion of existing message histories, we implemented a workaround by adding conversation messages to the archival history. However, we were unable to achieve successful question responses using this approach. We look forward to seeing evaluations of this benchmark by other research teams, as comparative performance data would benefit the broader development of LLM memory systems.",

Given that the current MemGPT framework does not support direct ingestion of existing message histories, we implemented a workaround by adding conversation messages to the archival history. However, we were unable to achieve successful question responses using this approach. We look forward to seeing evaluations of this benchmark by other research teams, as comparative performance data would benefit the broader development of LLM memory systems.",

Only set dates if they explicitly\nrelate to the formation or alteration of the relationship itself.\nGuidelines:\n1. Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSSSSZ) for datetimes.\n2. Use the reference timestamp as the current time when determining the valid_at and invalid_at dates.\n3. If the fact is written in the present tense, use the Reference Timestamp for the valid_at date\n4. If no temporal information is found that establishes or changes the relationship, leave the fields as null.\n5. Do not infer dates from related events. Only use dates that are directly stated to establish or change the relationship.\n6. For relative time mentions directly related to the relationship, calculate the actual datetime based on the reference\ntimestamp.\n7. If only a date is mentioned without a specific time, use 00:00:00 (midnight) for that date.\n8. If only year is mentioned, use January 1st of that year at 00:00:00.\n9. Always include the time zone offset (use Z for UTC if no specific time zone is mentioned).",

Use the reference timestamp as the current time when determining the valid_at and invalid_at dates.\n3. If the fact is written in the present tense, use the Reference Timestamp for the valid_at date\n4. If no temporal information is found that establishes or changes the relationship, leave the fields as null.\n5. Do not infer dates from related events. Only use dates that are directly stated to establish or change the relationship.\n6. For relative time mentions directly related to the relationship, calculate the actual datetime based on the reference\ntimestamp.\n7. If only a date is mentioned without a specific time, use 00:00:00 (midnight) for that date.\n8. If only year is mentioned, use January 1st of that year at 00:00:00.\n9. Always include the time zone offset (use Z for UTC if no specific time zone is mentioned).",
