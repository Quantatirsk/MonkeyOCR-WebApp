# 403 Forbidden Error Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were getting 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access original files via `/api/files/{task_id}/original` endpoint after the authentication system was implemented.

## Root Causes

### 1. Missing `is_public` field in database insert
The `add_task` method in `sqlite_persistence.py` was not including the `is_public` field when inserting tasks into the database, causing all tasks to default to `is_public = 0` (false).

### 2. Incorrect boolean parsing in upload endpoint
The upload endpoint was expecting a boolean type for `is_public`, but HTML forms send strings. This needed proper string-to-boolean conversion.

### 3. Incomplete access control logic
The file access endpoint needed to handle three scenarios:
- Anonymous/legacy tasks (user_id = None)
- Private tasks (user_id set, is_public = false)
- Public tasks (is_public = true)

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed database insertion (`utils/sqlite_persistence.py`)
```python
# Added is_public to INSERT query
query = """
    INSERT INTO processing_tasks (
        id, user_id, filename, file_type, file_hash, file_size,
        status, progress, extraction_type, split_pages,
        total_pages, created_at, metadata, is_public
    ) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
"""

# Convert boolean to SQLite integer
params = (
    ...
    1 if task.is_public else 0  # Convert boolean to SQLite integer
)
```

### 2. Fixed boolean parsing (`api/upload.py`)
```python
# Changed from bool to str type
is_public: str = Form("false"),

# Parse string to boolean
is_public_bool = is_public.lower() in ['true', '1', 'yes']

# Only authenticated users can make tasks public
if is_public_bool and not current_user:
    is_public_bool = False
```

### 3. Improved access control logic (`api/sync.py`)
```python
# Simplified and clear access control
if task.is_public:
    # Public tasks are accessible to everyone
    pass
elif task.user_id is None:
    # Anonymous/legacy tasks are accessible to everyone
    pass
elif current_user and task.user_id == current_user.get("user_id"):
    # User owns the task
    pass
else:
    # Access denied
    raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")
```

### 4. Added user context to endpoints
- `/api/tasks` - Filter tasks based on authenticated user
- `/api/sync` - Include user context for proper filtering
- `/tasks/{task_id}` DELETE - Only allow owner to delete tasks

## Database Reset
A complete database reset was performed to ensure clean state:
```bash
python reset_database.py
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify all access scenarios:

1. **Anonymous Tasks**: Accessible to everyone ✅
2. **Private Tasks**: Only accessible to owner ✅
3. **Public Tasks**: Accessible to everyone ✅

Test files created:
- `test_fresh_system.py` - Full test suite
- `test_file_access.py` - File access specific tests
- `test_public_task_debug.py` - Debug public task issues
- `check_task_db.py` - Database inspection tool
- `reset_database.py` - Database reset utility

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED** - All file access permissions are working correctly:
- Anonymous users can upload and access their files
- Authenticated users can protect their files
- Public files are accessible to everyone
- Private files are only accessible to their owners
