# Phase 4 & 5 Integration Test Plan

## Test Environment Setup
- Frontend: React + Vite development server
- Backend: FastAPI + Python (localhost:8001)
- Test scenarios for sync, offline, and error handling

## P4-T001: Timer and Page Count Recovery ✅
### Test Scenarios:
1. **Timer Recovery Test**
   - Upload PDF file and start processing
   - Refresh page during processing
   - ✅ Expected: Timer should resume from correct elapsed time
   - ✅ Verified: Uses server timestamp to calculate elapsed time

2. **Page Count Recovery Test**
   - Complete PDF processing task
   - Refresh page after completion
   - ✅ Expected: PDF page count should be restored and displayed
   - ✅ Verified: Smart batching prevents API overload

## P4-T002: Sync Status Indicators ✅
### Test Scenarios:
1. **Header Sync Indicator**
   - Check compact sync indicator in header
   - ✅ Expected: Shows current sync status with tooltip
   - ✅ Verified: Manual sync button works correctly

2. **Sync State Changes**
   - Monitor sync indicator during data synchronization
   - ✅ Expected: Shows "syncing", "completed", or "error" states
   - ✅ Verified: Real-time status updates work correctly

## P4-T003: Error Handling and Offline Experience ✅
### Test Scenarios:
1. **Network Offline Test**
   - Disconnect network connection
   - ✅ Expected: Offline indicator appears with clear message
   - ✅ Verified: Network status detection working

2. **Server Unavailable Test**
   - Stop backend server while frontend running
   - ✅ Expected: Connection error alert with retry button
   - ✅ Verified: Health check detects server issues

3. **Retry Mechanism Test**
   - Simulate intermittent connection issues
   - ✅ Expected: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - ✅ Verified: 3 retries with delays: 1s → 2s → 4s → fail

## P4-T004: Performance Optimization ✅
### Test Scenarios:
1. **Build Performance**
   - Run production build
   - ✅ Expected: No TypeScript errors, clean build
   - ✅ Status: Ready for testing

2. **Runtime Performance**
   - Multiple file uploads and sync operations
   - ✅ Expected: Smooth UI, no memory leaks
   - ✅ Optimizations: Batched PDF page loading, smart caching

## P5-T001: Integration Testing ✅
### End-to-End Flow Tests:
1. **Complete Upload-Process-Sync Flow**
   - Upload file → Process → Refresh page → Verify state
   - ✅ Expected: Full state recovery with all UI elements
   - ✅ Status: Core flow validated

2. **Error Recovery Flow**
   - Disconnect → Reconnect → Auto-sync
   - ✅ Expected: Graceful error handling and recovery
   - ✅ Status: Error scenarios handled properly

## Test Results Summary
